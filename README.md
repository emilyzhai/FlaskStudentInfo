# FlaskStudentInfo
use flask and mysql to build my web server.
My project is a web platform to achieve the functional of create,insert,update and delete through flask and mysql.
My database name is 'db_test' including a table called 'student' which has five columns :sno,name,sex,birthday,class
So,you should first create a db and a table,you also can insert some datas.
Then,in the app.py,you should modify the pymysql.connect(host=""your host",port=3306,user='your db user',password='your password',db='your db')
Finallyï¼Œyou can run the app.py,then you will see the result in the browser.
